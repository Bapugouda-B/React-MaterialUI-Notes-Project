## ```json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000 ```
when you run this command, json-server starts a web server that serves the JSON data from the "db.json" file, and you can access this data through a web browser or by making HTTP requests to the server, typically at http://localhost:8000 (if you run it on your local machine). This can be really useful for testing and development when you're building web applications that need data from a server but don't have a real server set up yet
